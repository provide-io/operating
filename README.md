## About

This repository is meant to facilitate verified updates to our versioned Operating Agreements and other key governance documents for provide.io.

## Introduction

Our goal: Provide systems, tools, and information, to facilitate the next generation of equitable, and emotionally aware, social enterprises. We want to integrate DEIA, such as neurodivergence support, into the core of the businesses operating model.

We will provide members with personalized education plans during the onboarding process through the use of a psychoeducational curriculum, fostering a culture of self-care, positive conflict resolution, and introspection.

Imagine this - provide.io finds a group of entrepreneurial catering specialistes and persuades them to evaluate our support platform. Once that team of caterers are formed as a smaller LLC, we will manage the logistics required to get the new LLC owners funded, marketed, and running.

We will leverage non-profits, grants, crowd incubation, and other viable funding tools to fund the new small cooperative.

We will then design rapid-feedback assessment loops, we will enable the formation of a new kind of centralized decentralized system. When the model is defined, and we begin testing it, we will be calling the platform the Integrated Cooperative Network.

Another example - provide.io can form teams of knowledge workers to generate new IP. Then provide.io will leverage a cooperative owned entity with a traditional organizational structure that supports investment from traditional public-market systems.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* `governance`: Contains versioned documents related to the organizations' governance, including Operating Agreements, Bylaws, and Articles of Incorporation.
* `reports`: Stores Annual Reports highlighting the organizations' activities and financial performance.
* `policies`: Includes documents outlining the organizations' policies and procedures, such as Code of Conduct, Conflict of Interest Policy, and Whistleblower Policy.
* `faq`: Contains Frequently Asked Questions documents.

## Versioning

In contrast to traditional amendment-based approaches, the Operating Agreements (OAs) within this repository utilize an innovative versioning system. This method allows for a more flexible and efficient way to track changes and updates to the documents over time, without the need for formal amendments.

Each time a significant change or update is made to an Operating Agreement, a new version of the document is created. This is indicated by appending a version number to the file name, such as `operating-agreement-2024.03.14.md`, `operating-agreement-2024.11.11.md`, and so on.

The version number is incremented each time a new version is created, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify the most current version of the document.

This versioning system offers several advantages over traditional amendment-based approaches:

1. **Clarity and transparency:** By providing a complete history of changes to the Operating Agreement, stakeholders can easily review and understand how the document has evolved over time. This fosters trust and transparency within the organization.
2. **Efficiency:** Making changes to an Operating Agreement using this versioning system is generally faster and more straightforward than the traditional process of drafting, approving, and ratifying amendments.
3. **Flexibility:** The versioning system allows for more frequent updates to the Operating Agreement, enabling the organization to adapt more quickly to changing circumstances or new information.
4. **Easy comparison:** With each version of the document preserved, stakeholders can compare different versions side by side to understand the specific changes made in each iteration. This facilitates better decision-making and collaboration among stakeholders.
