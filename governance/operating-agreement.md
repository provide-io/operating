**Version:** 2024.03.14.00

This Operating Agreement is version controlled, and any changes to the document will be tracked and recorded with signed commit messages. The version specified at the top of this document determines the active and voted-upon version of the agreement.

**Definitions:**

- "provide.io": provide.io llc, a democratically driven, cooperative-inspired, organization.
- "Operating Agreement" or "OA": This document, intended to serve as the initial alpha operating agreement for provide.io.
- "Incubation Leadership Team" or "ILT": A team consisting of 5 to 9 members, responsible for driving the mission, values, vision, and viability of provide.io during its incubation period.
- "ICN": Integrated Cooperative Network, a system designed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration among various entities.

**Formation:** provide.io is formed as a sole-member LLC with the intention of transitioning to a democratically governed structure in the future, subject to the Incubation Leadership Team's vote.

**Purpose:** The initial purpose of provide.io is to architect the Integrated Cooperative Network (ICN). The Incubation Leadership Team will vote on the viability of deploying the ICN.

**Incubation Leadership Team Composition:** The Incubation Leadership Team shall consist of 5 to 9 members. The team will include roles such as Team Lead, Strategy and Planning Specialist, Financial Analyst, Marketing and Outreach Coordinator, Product Development and Management Expert, and Operations and HR Specialist.

**Role Application and Interviews:** Roles within the ILT will be applied for and filled through an interview process. Tim Perkins, the initial member of provide.io, will be involved in all interviews and will be responsible for assembling the ILT.

**Decision Making:** The Incubation Leadership Team shall make decisions through a voting process, with an odd number of members to avoid split votes. Decisions shall be made in the best interest of provide.io and its objectives.

**Leadership Votes:** Leadership votes may not be resold or transferred. If a team member abandons their vote, the remaining team members may discuss and solicit a replacement to represent the abandoned vote.

**ICN Viability Vote:** Within 13 months, the Incubation Leadership Team must vote on whether the ICN strategy is viable and can be executed. A majority vote in favor of the ICN's viability is required for provide.io to continue developing and deploying the ICN.

**Compensation:** Compensation for Incubation Leadership Team members shall be determined by the team and approved by a majority vote.

**Intellectual Property:** If, at the end of the 13-month incubation period, the Incubation Leadership Team has not voted in favor of the ICN's viability, all Intellectual Property (IP), brands, and other assets shall revert back to Tim Perkins, the initial member of provide.io.

**Entity Formation:** If the ICN is deemed viable, the Incubation Leadership Team must then vote on whether to formally establish provide.io as an operating entity to deploy and manage the ICN. A majority vote in favor of formation is required for provide.io to continue operations beyond the incubation period.

**Governing Law:** This Operating Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which provide.io is formed.

By expressing interest and joining the Incubation Leadership Team, each member agrees to be bound by the terms of this Operating Agreement.
