# provide.io: Notice of Intention

**Version:** 2024.03.14.00

This notice serves as an expression of intention to form a dedicated team that will be responsible for driving the mission, values, vision, and viability, of a new democratically driven, cooperative-like, organization: **provide.io llc**.

The core objective of the future provide.io team is to develop and execute strategies that will lead to models, and frameworks, that are testable, within 13 months, as voted by the core leadership and development team.

The number of core leadership positions will be **extremely** - 5 to 9. There is a form at the bottom of this notice with a link to fill out out the **[provide.io Notice of Intention contact form](https://intent.provide.io/)**.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Team Lead:** The Team Lead will be responsible for managing the team, overseeing progress, and reporting to the core team. They will ensure that all members are working towards the common goal of achieving financial viability and sustainability within the specified timeframe.

2. **Strategy and Planning Specialist:** This individual will be responsible for developing a comprehensive strategic plan, identifying key milestones, and outlining the necessary steps to achieve financial viability within 13 months.

3. **Financial Analyst:** The Financial Analyst will create financial projections, analyze revenue streams, and identify cost-saving opportunities to ensure that the organization achieves its financial objectives.

4. **Marketing and Outreach Coordinator:** This team member will be responsible for developing and executing marketing strategies and outreach initiatives to increase awareness, engage stakeholders, and drive growth.

5. **Product Development and Management Expert:** The Product Development and Management Expert will be responsible for managing the organization's products and services, ensuring they align with the strategic plan, and identifying opportunities for growth and improvement.

6. **Operations and HR Specialist:** This individual will oversee daily operations, manage human resources, and ensure that the organization has the necessary resources and support to achieve its goals.

7. **To Be Determined :** As the core leadership team is formed, this Notice of Intention is subject to change without any notice.

The core team will consist of an odd-numbered of key stakeholders, and decision-makers within the organization, who will evaluate the progress and achievements of the assembled team at the 13-month mark. The number of core provide.io process and product architects must be odd so that there are never split votes.

When the team has formed, and our roles, responsibilities, compensations, etc., a vote will be held to determine whether the team has successfully achieved its objective of establishing a financially viable and self-sustaining organization.

**provide.io llc** is currently a sole-member LLC. However, the next major version of the Operating Agreement must define how provide.io's structure is democratically governed.

That saidâ€¦

I, Tim, am dedicated to building a diverse, skilled, and driven team with a sense of humor, united in their commitment to achieve our ambitious goal of creating a more democratic organizational future.

We invite (hopefully *you*) knowledgeable leaders with strong psychosocial, and socioemotional, skills to join us in this endeavor, contributing their expertise to the success of provide.io and the intent to build an Integrated Cooperative Network.

Our core team will consist of *only 5 to 9 members*, meaning leadership positions will be **highly limited**. If you're curious, intrigued, excited, and any other synonyms, about developing networked cooperative systems, and shaping provide.io's structure and culture, then reach out now!

Let's build something amazing!

Sincerely,

Tim C Perkins

provide.io / founder / owner member

P.S. It's waaaaay more ambitious than just provide.io. These are gonna be interesting experiments when the Integrated Criteria Evaluation (ICE), and the Human Integration (HIP) models begin to get integrated.

I'm excited.

P.P.S. Until there's anyone other than me writing this stuff, then I reserve the right to update terms whenever I want. And by terms I mean spelling mistakes, probably.
